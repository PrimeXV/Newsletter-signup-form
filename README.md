## My process

solved in 4 days after several thought on how to break down the picture to code i can write

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap) - For styles



### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: none !important;
}   // To let the property none apply to the element irrespective of anything that might want to override it. but it isn't best practice to use it always.
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   e.preventDefault(); // to prevent reloading of the page.
}
```


### Continued development

I would love to continue learning JavaScript framework like React to make life more easy for me when building website.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/eJi34zHscXA?si=gHI4zbNP6EL6Jok_) - This helped me for insight on how to arrange the picture and the newsletter div in grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://youtu.be/CYlNJpltjMM?si=rt54lRho-aoTcIsE) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how the error message works in the form validation. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
